# Task08: Neural Network

**Announcement**: Apr 01, 2024        
**1st due date**: Apr 18, 2024 before 11:59pm   
**2nd due date**: Apr 21, 2024 before 11:59pm       

## Objective
The primary objective of this assignment is to grasp the basics of neural networks by developing your own models. You are required to study "Tutorial: Neural Network from Scratch" (named `NN tutorial`) and "Forward and Back-propagation" **thoroughly**. Your code should adhere to the notation and coding conventions established in these tutorials. **The use of external neural network libraries is prohibited for this task.**

Tutorials
* [tutorial_neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb](tutorial_neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb)
* [forward_and_back_propagation.ipynb](forward_and_back_propagation.ipynb)

Jupyter notebook: [Task08_neural_network_ChulminYeum.ipynb](Task08_neural_network_ChulminYeum.ipynb)

## Submission Guidelines
* Students must submit both a Jupyter notebook file and its PDF conversion.
* The primary grading will be based on the PDF file, but the notebook file may be executed if necessary.
* Ensure all results are executed and displayed in the Jupyter notebook before conversion to PDF. 
* Include your full name (first and last) at the end of the file names. For example, `Task08_neural_network_ChulminYeum.ipynb` and `Task08_neural_network_ChulminYeum.pdf`.
* Your submission should include a report in both .pdf and .ipynb formats, contained within a folder. 
* Ensure to include all necessary files within the folder that are required for the successful execution of the Jupyter notebook file.
* The folder, named `Task08_YourName_YourID`, should be zipped before emailing. For example, if your name and ID are Chulmin Yeum and 214102, the folder name becomes `Task08_ChulminYeum_214102`
* Email your work to `uw.task@gmail.com` and cc yourself. Use the subject format `Task08_YourName_YourID`.
* Review the general submission instructions in the course syllabus for further details.
* When you violate these submission guidelines, your report may be returned. 

## Notes
* Please post a question if you need to help understand the problem and/or tutorials. 
* You are permitted to discuss the task with your colleagues, but do not copy the solutions.     
* Your grade depends on the completeness and clarity of your work.  
* You should include clear and concise comments in your codes.
