**Announcement**: Mar 27, 2022        
**1st due date**: Apr 11, 2022 before 11:59pm
**2nd due date**: Apr 18, 2022 before 11:59pm       

The main goal of this task is to understand the fundamental of structure from motion through developing your own measurement tool. A draft of a code (`demo_code_v8_base.m`) is provided and you need to write your own codes in `YOUR CODE HERE` to complete your tool. 11 Problems  and relevant guidelines are included in the code.   

If you can solve all 11 problems using Python, you will get extra 10 points.
