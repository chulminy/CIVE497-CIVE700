You are required to study \"Tutorial: Neural Network from Scratch\" (named `NN tutorial`) and \"Forward and Back-propagation\" **thoroughly**. Your code should adhere to the notation and coding conventions established in these tutorials. **The use of external neural network libraries is prohibited for this task.**\n",
