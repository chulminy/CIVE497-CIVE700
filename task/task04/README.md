Your answers do not have to be lengthy but should not be too short. Note that you are allowed to use the DSLR images provided in the link below but **you need to provide a suitable reason for why your smartphone camera cannot take the corresponding images.** You can download the instructor's images from [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3setnfjjq18ekg1/img_cive497.zip?dl=0).
