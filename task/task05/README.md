Jupyter notebook: [Task05_image_processing_ChulminYeum.ipynb](Task05_image_processing_ChulminYeum.ipynb)

## Submission Guidelines
* Students must submit both a Jupyter notebook file and its PDF conversion.
* The primary grading will be based on the PDF file, but the notebook file may be executed if necessary.
* Ensure all results are executed and displayed in the Jupyter notebook before conversion to PDF. 
* Include your full name (first and last) at the end of the file names. For example, `Task05_image_processing_ChulminYeum.ipynb` and `Task05_image_processing_ChulminYeum.pdf`.
* Your submission should include a report in both .pdf and .ipynb formats, contained within a folder. 
* Ensure to include all necessary files within the folder that are required for the successful execution of the Jupyter notebook file.
* The folder, named `Task05_YourName_YourID`, should be zipped before emailing. For example, if your name and ID are Chulmin Yeum and 214102, the folder name becomes `Task04_ChulminYeum_214102`
* Email your work to `uw.task@gmail.com` and cc yourself. Use the subject format `Task05_YourName_YourID`.
* Review the general submission instructions in the course syllabus for further details.
* When you violate these submission guidelines, your report may be returned.
