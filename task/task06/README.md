**Announcement**: March 10, 2025        
**1st due date**: March 20, 2025 before 11:59pm   
**2nd due date**: March 27, 2025 before 11:59pm         

## Objective
The main goal of this task is to understand the fundamental of a feature extraction and matching method (Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)) and a Random sample consensus (RANSAC) method to estimate model parameters. You must study the relevant tutorials to solve the corresponding problems. Please answer all sub-questions in each problem. 

Jupyter notebook: [Task06_feature_ChulminYeum.ipynb](Task06_feature_ChulminYeum.ipynb)

## Submission Guidelines
* Students must submit both a Jupyter notebook file and its PDF conversion.
* The primary grading will be based on the PDF file, but the notebook file may be executed if necessary.
* Ensure all results are executed and displayed in the Jupyter notebook before conversion to PDF. 
* Include your full name (first and last) at the end of the file names. For example, `Task06_feature_ChulminYeum.ipynb` and `Task06_feature_ChulminYeum.ipynb.pdf`.
* Your submission should include a report in both .pdf and .ipynb formats, contained within a folder. 
* Ensure to include all necessary files within the folder that are required for the successful execution of the Jupyter notebook file.
* The folder, named `Task06_YourName_YourID`, should be zipped before emailing. For example, if your name and ID are Chulmin Yeum and 214102, the folder name becomes `Task06_ChulminYeum_214102`
* Email your work to `uw.task@gmail.com` and cc yourself. Use the subject format `Task06_YourName_YourID`.
* Review the general submission instructions in the course syllabus for further details.
* When you violate these submission guidelines, your report may be returned. 

## Notes
* Please post a question if you need to help understand the problem and/or tutorials. 
* You are permitted to discuss the task with your colleagues, but do not copy the solutions.     
* Your grade depends on the completeness and clarity of your work.
