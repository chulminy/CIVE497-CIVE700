    "## Problem 4: Improved 3D Planar Measurement Tool (20 points)\n",
    "You will develop an enhanced 3D planar measurement application. This tool is engineered for measuring 3D distances on a plane by eliminating the need to pre-select the corners of a calibration paper (in this case, a booklet), like the previous task. Users will photograph a planar surface with the calibration paper positioned on it and then select any two points within the image to obtain measurements. This streamlines the process by removing the requirement to identify the calibration paper's corners beforehand. Below is a demonstration video:\n",

    "**(a)** To complete this task, you're tasked with creating your own measurement tool and assessing its accuracy using the images in the `prob4` folder. Below is a template code to get you started, but you'll need to design the `fun_measurement` function by yourself. A critical part of this assignment involves estimating homography through SIFT feature matching. Keep in mind that the booklet you'll use for calibration, as depicted in `cover.jpg`, has dimensions of 24 cm x 31.5 cm. The distance that you will be measured in each image is already provided at `pts`, which is 10 cm. The measurement from your tool should be similar to 10 cm like the demo video above. \n",

    "**(b)** Prepare your own calibration paper and take photos similar to the ones in (a). Then, evaluate your tool. \n",

    "**(c)** Compare measurements using this new tool and the one developed in Task 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you **should not do hard cording**. This means the corner points of the booklet on your **test image** is completely unknown and must be detected or measured with your code.  "

Please replace (or overlay) the A♠ card with the A♥ card. The quality of the overlay is similar to the ones in the video above. You should not do hard cording to find out the sequence and card overlay. For example, the sequence text should be autoamtically generated from the card sequence that you identify from the code.
