# Task1: Programming Practice

**Announcement**: January 6, 2019  
**Due Date**: January 15, 2019 (Wednesday) before 11:59 pm  

The main goal of this task is to practice programming to solve upcoming task assignments throughout the course. It is a good time for reviewing the programming 101 course that you took in your undergraduate. You should write your program in MATLAB. Three problems are posted in MATLAB grader. This tool gives you instant feedback on the correctness of your solution through the pre-designed tester. You can solve the problem until you pass all the testers in each problem. Please avoid hard coding!

**Submission of Your Work**
* You should turn in a report to uw.task@gmail.com. When you send your email, please cc your email for future reference.  
* A subject of your email must be the format of "Task1_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`"
	* `Your name`: first five letter your first + last name. It should be lower case. (i.g Chul Min Yeum -> chulmi, Juan Park -> Juanp)   
	* `Degree`: pick your degree among BA, ME, MA, and PH (BA=Undergraduate, ME=MEng, MA=MASc, and PH=PhD)  
	* `ID`: your school ID
	* Please do not include any other text except this subject line.    
* Your report includes styled codes for all three problems (please check the Markdown tutorial for code styling). Please see the sample report format [**here**](Task0_Juanp_BA_000000). 
* The report must be written with Markdown script (GFM) and all other formats like docx or pptx are not permitted. 
* You should also include a report in pdf that is converted from your report in Markdown.

* The formats of the folder and files are 
	* Folder name: Task1_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID` (same with the subject of your email)  
	* File names: "Rept_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`.md and .pdf".
