# Task0: MATLAB & Digital Image Processing Tutorial

**Announcement**: January 10, 2019  
**1st Due Date**: January 19, 2019 (Saturday) before 11:59 pm  
**2nd Due Date**: January 26, 2019 (Saturday) before 11:59 pm  

The main goal of this task is to develop your programming skill to solve upcoming task assignments throughout the course. You must complete three tutorials (`matrices_arrays.mlx`, `operators_elem_operations.mlx`, `digital_image_processing.mlx`) to solve corresponding problems. Please write your own code to address the following problems:

**Problem 1**: Solve *exercise 001~003* in `matrices_arrays.mlx`  
**Problem 2**: Solve *exercise 001* in `operators_elem_operations.mlx`   
**Problem 3**: Solve *exercise 001* in `digital_image_processing.mlx`  
**Problem 4**: Solve *exercise 002* in `digital_image_processing.mlx`  
**Problem 5**: Solve *exercise 003* in `digital_image_processing.mlx`  

- You can write your codes using either MATLAB or Python. In MATLAB, you can print out your results in a command window. In Python, please use [**pandas**](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/10min.html) to nicely print out your result.
- Your code blocks each problem are included in a single *.m* or *.py* file. If the file is executed, all results for exercises are printed at once.   

**Problem 6**: Answer the following questions in `digital_image_processing.mlx`  
Q.003, Q.004, Q.006, Q.007, Q.010, Q.011, Q.012, Q.013, Q.016, 

- Your answers are included in the report. 
- Please avoid a lengthy explanation.

**Submission of Your Work**
* You should turn in a report and codes to uw.task@gmail.com. When you send your email, please cc your email for future reference.  
* A subject of your email must be the format of "Task0_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`"
	* `Your name`: first five letter your first + last name. It should be lower case. (i.g Chul Min Yeum -> chulmi, Juan Park -> Juanp)   
	* `Degree`: pick your degree among BA, ME, MA, and PH (BA=Undergraduate, ME=MEng, MA=MASc, and PH=PhD)  
	* `ID`: your school ID
	* Please do not include any other text except this subject line.    
* Your report includes (1) styled codes for Problems 1~5 (please check the Markdown tutorial for code styling) and (2) answers for Problem 6. Please see the sample report format [**here**](Task0_Juanp_BA_000000). 
* The report must be written with Markdown script (GFM) and all other formats like docx or pptx are not permitted. 
* You should also include a report in pdf that is converted from your report in Markdown.  
* In your submission folder, you should include a single report, code files, and the other files (if necessary) in a folder. And, it should be zipped before attaching it to your email. 
* The formats of the folder and files are 
	* Folder name: Task0_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID` (same with the subject of your email)  
	* File names: "Prb1_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`.m or .py" for codes and "Rept_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`.md and .pdf".   
* Please review the general submission instruction in the course syllabus. 
* When you violate these submission guideline, your report will be returned and must be resubmitted. 

> For example, Juan Park is using MATLAB to complete the Task0. Juan need to submit his report and codes to **uw.task@gmail.com** with an attachment of **Task0_Juanp_BA_000000.zip**. In the folder, there are at least seven files: 
> * Prb1_Juanp_BA_000000.m
> * Prb2_Juanp_BA_000000.m
> * Prb3_Juanp_BA_000000.m
> * Prb4_Juanp_BA_000000.m
> * Prb5_Juanp_BA_000000.m
> * Rept_Juanp_BA_000000.md
> * Rept_Juanp_BA_000000.pdf

**Note**
* You are permitted to discuss the task with your colleague.  
* Your grade depends on the completeness and clarity of your work. 
* You should include clear and concise comments in your codes.
