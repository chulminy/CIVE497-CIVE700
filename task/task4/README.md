# Task4: Digital Image Processing & Camera Sensor and Digital Image
**Announcement**: February  07, 2020    
**Due date**: February 23, 2020   

## Problem 1
The main goal of this problem is to review a tutorial for [**Digital Image Processing**](../../tutorial/image_proc). Copy this folder in your computer and run `digital_image_processing.mlx` in MATLAB (Note: If you do not find the sample images, you can download them from [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xgznul2u1l16iaw/sample_images.zip?dl=0)). Please answer the following questions in 'digital_image_processing.mlx': 
Q.001, Q.002, Q.005, Q.008, Q.009, Q.010, Q.013, Q.016   
        

## Problem 2
The main goal of this problem is to learn a working principle of a digital camera and how to take quality photos using your camera. Students are encouraged to actively search for relevant information on the web, such as wiki, article, or tutorial videos. Please answer the following questions:   

**Q1. What is a good image sensor? Why are the high-end DSLR cameras expensive?**  

**Q2. What is the difference between optical and digital zooms?**

**Q3. Why did the apple make "stove-top" iPhone 11?**

> **(Q4~Q9)** Please explain and demonstrate the following functions/effects using your own images. Also, you can also explain when you change their values on a camera. Your answers are graded based on both the correctness and extensively considering various potential situations. Your answers do not have to be lengthy but should not be short. Note that you are allowed to use the DSLR images provided but you need to provide a suitable reason for why your smart phone camera cannot take the corresponding images. You can download the instructor's images from [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3setnfjjq18ekg1/img_cive497.zip?dl=0).
 
**Q4. Shutter speed (Exposure time)**

**Q5. Aperture**

**Q6. ISO**

**Q7. Flash**

**Q8. Focal length**

**Q9. Field of view**
