## Course Description
This course offers an introduction to the emerging **smart structure technologies** in civil engineering. Smart structures integrate sensing, actuation, data processing, analysis, and visualization, and control capabilities so that a structure can sense and respond to its changing external conditions in a rapid and automated manner. Among several topics in smart structure, this course focuses on [**structural assessment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_health_monitoring) using optical sensor data by implementing state-of-art image processing and computer vision techniques. As a special topic, basic concepts in **structure from motion**, **machine learning**, **neural networks**, and **neural radiance fields (NeRF)** are covered and relevant applications in civil engineering are introduced. An application-based learning approach is emphasized and tasks are designed in such a way that students can implement smart structure technology to address contemporary problems in civil engineering. 

This course is specially designed to suit the interest of **graduate students** and **senior undergraduate students who may pursue graduate studies**. You can see the course outline and task assignments in the previous year from [**w2024**](previous/w2024), [**w2022**](previous/w2022), [**w2021**](previous/w2021), [**w2020**](previous/w2020), [**w2019**](previous/w2019).  Note that all lectures were already delivered through [**pre-recorded videos**](#lecture-video) in 2021. When you are absent from a class, you can watch the corresponding lecture video. However, students are highly encouraged to attend the classes. 

Based on past course surveys, students should anticipate dedicating **at least 10 hours per week** to study class materials, work on assignments, and undertake research projects. Additionally, a strong background in computer programming is expected of students. **If you are unsure about allocating this much time, please carefully reconsider enrollment.** For undergraduates, be aware that the instructor will not accommodate personal situations, like capstone projects, quizzes, midterms, or finals, that do not adhere to institutional policies and guidelines.

## Tasks
There will be **8 tasks** and **1 Quiz** and they will be posted on this course website weekly or bi-weekly. **The instructor encourage students to work in groups through collaborative learning, but to submit their assignments individually.** The task will have programming components or photography components, where students will use their own camera to capture and process their own images and discuss the results. Students are supposed to complete all tasks and turn their works in by the due date. You can access the best reports for the assignments in previous years from [**w2024**](previous/w2024#tasks), [**w2022**](previous/w2022#tasks), [**w2021**](previous/w2021#tasks), [**w2020**](previous/w2020#tasks), and [**w2019**](previous/w2019#tasks). The problems will be similar to the ones in the previous assignments. However, **the students must not copy and paste the codes or texts in those reports.** Also, some answers in the model report are not correct.     

Students are required to use **Python** for all assignments. Your source code should be well-organized and thoroughly commented. Submission must include both the source code (along with any data used) and a report. The report should be initially written in **Jupyter notebook** and then converted to PDF format. Each assignment will come with its specific submission guidelines. Please note that your grade will be based on the PDF report. Ensure that it includes all necessary figures and texts before submission.

Regarding late submissions, you are allowed a **maximum one-week** extension for up to **three of the first eight assignments**. However, the final assignment must be submitted on time. **Exceeding three late submissions will result in a score of zero for the fourth late assignment.** Be mindful of deadlines; extensions beyond this policy will only be considered under exceptional circumstances and may incur a penalty.

Graded reports will be sent via email. Additionally, sample solutions will be discussed in class, and with their permission, outstanding student reports may be shared on the class webpage.

Your final grade in this course depends significantly on your assignment scores. Therefore, not submitting homework could adversely affect your overall grade. **If you're facing difficulties with the assignments, don't hesitate to contact the instructor or TA for help.**

## Grading  
The final grade will be determined by the cumulative marks obtained throughout the semester. Individual grades for each task can be found in the table under [**Tasks**](#tasks). The final grade is the sum of the grades awarded to students for each task.

## Communication  
**All communication will be made through [this course website](https://github.com/chulminy/CIVE497-CIVE700)**, especially for this web page. The instructor will make a note in the ["Announcement"](#announcement) section if there is an update on the web page. Students can configure email notification for by ["watching"](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories/) this course website or use a version control system for tracking its changes. Thus, **students are responsible for checking the website regularly** for any relevant course information or announcements. 

In this course, both the instructor and the students are encouraged to engage in online discussions to create and facilitate a collaborative learning experience. Students are invited to ask questions and answer them, and share their knowledge and resources. **Please direct your communication to a** [***Discussion***](https://github.com/chulminy/CIVE497-CIVE700/discussions) **board (tab) on this website.** However, if there is a good reason not to use the discussion forum (e.g. personal matters, a question that might reveal your solution of your report, etc.), please directly contact the instructor via email (cmyeum@uwaterloo.ca). Or, you can feel free to send messages the instructor or TA through Microsoft TEAM. You can check out this [website](https://uwaterloo.ca/office-365/about/apps-you-have-access/teams). If possible, the instructor and TA prefer to use the discussion forum because questions and responses can be shared to the other students.    

**Discussion forum instruction**

- Students are allowed to use either their own GitHub account or new account for this class if you want anonymity. They do not have to make a new account using their university email accounts. 
- Please be respectful of your peers, instructor, and others in your posts and comments.
- Asking good questions is another way of learning by summarizing and explaining what you know and do not know. Thoughtful questions and answers will help all students in this class. Before posting a question, please ask yourself whether you are truly stuck (meaning that the answers can be readily found on the web) and your question are complete and legible. 
- In addition, please check if the same question was asked before.   
- Inappropriate posts and comments are immediately deleted and closed without a notice. 

## Notes
