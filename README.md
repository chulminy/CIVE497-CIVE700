## Course Description
This course offers an introduction to the emerging smart structure technologies in civil engineering. Smart structures integrate sensing, actuation, data processing and analysis, and control capabilities so that a structure can sense and respond to its changing external conditions in a rapid and automated manner. Among several topics in smart structure, this course focuses on structural assessment using optical sensor data by implementing state-of-art image processing and computer vision techniques. As a special topic, basic concepts in machine learning, neural networks, convolutional neural networks (deep learning) are covered and relevant applications in civil engineering are introduced. An application-based learning approach is emphasized and homework assignments are designed in such a way that students implement smart structure technology to address contemporary problems in civil engineering.  In addition, one of the requirements for this course will be a research project, in which student will have an opportunity to design a technique with a potential application to smart structures. This course is specially designed to suit the interest of graduate students and senior undergraduate students who will pursue graduate studies.  

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students should be able to  
  
* List smart structure technology and its application in civil engineering

## Communication  
**All communication will be made through this course website**, especially for this web page. The instructor will make a note in the "Announcement" section after updating this web page. Students can configure email notification for this course website (repository) or use a version control system for tracking its changes. Thus, **students are responsible for checking the website regularly** for any relevant course information or announcements. 

This class strongly encourages students and the instructor collaborative learning through a **discussion forum** on this website. Students feel free to ask questions and answer them and share their knowledge and resources. **Please direct your communication to an *Issues* board (tab) on this website.** However, if there is a good reason not to use the discussion forum (e.g. personal matters, a question that might reveal your solution of your homework assignment, etc.), please directly contact the instructor via email (cmyeum@uwaterloo.ca) or use the office hours. 

Here are some instructions to use this discussion forum:  
- Students are allowed to use either their own GitHub account or new account for this class if you want anonymity. They do not have to make a new account using their university email accounts. 
- Please be respectful of your peers, instructor, and others in your posts and comments.
- Asking good questions is another way of learning by summarizing and explaining what you know and do not know. Thoughtful questions and answers will help all students in this class. Before posting a question, please ask yourself whether you are truly stuck (meaning that the answers can be readily found on the web) or the other students can understand your problem correctly.  
- When students write a post on the *Issues* board, please assign an appropriate label among "Homework", "Class", "Project", "Resource", and "Suggestion"). An "Announcement" label is for instructor use only. 

## Grading  
The final grade will be based on the total marks earned during the semester. Each homework assignment will be graded on the basis of 100 points and will contribute the final grade with different weights. The evaluation guideline for the project will be provided near future. Note that undergraduate and graduate students are marked using different evaluation metrics.

- **Undergraduate student**: assignment (80%) and project (20%)  
- **Graduate student**: assignment (60%) and project (40%)

## Homework Assignment 
There will be **eight assignments** posted every one or two weeks on this course website. The homework assignments will have programming components or photography components, where students will use their own camera to capture and process their own images and discuss the results. Students are expected to complete all assignments and turn them in before the 1st and 2nd due date. After the 1st due data, some hints and solutions will be posted but, you lose 25% of the total points. After the 2nd due date, the assignments will not be accepted unless accompanied by a valid excuse and some additional points might be deducted depending upon the circumstances. 

Students must **electronically** turn in both your code and discussion of your results after integrating them in either **Live Script in MATLAB** or **iPhython in a Jupyter Notebook**. All submissions in other electrical formats like pdf, docx, or pptx, or in hardcopy are not permitted. The instructor may run your report in the instructor's Window computer where MATLAB 2018b and Jupyter Notebook supporting Python above 3.4 are installed. The instructor recommends the use of MATLAB for this course because students and instructors do not need to install task-specific code libraries to test each homework and the instructor can provide students with more useful programming guidance. However, the use of Python for the homework assignments is accepted but, the students do their own risk if your report is not running on the instructor's computer. Pillow and OpenCV for computer vision programming and some basic python packages (e.g. Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, sklearn, etc) will be installed on the computer. It is recommended that any external code library is not used unless explicitly mentioned in the homework assignment. **The instructor is not able to install every different libraries on the computer.** If there is a convincing reason for the use of specific libraries, please contact the instructor in advance and exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis. Note that OS(platform)-dependent functions, scripts or libraries are not permitted. The students must check their report in a Window computer before its submission.   

Solutions for homework assignments will be reviewed in class with the instructor and a couple of the best reports in each homework assignment will be posted on the class web page with the consent of the corresponding students. 

## Project 
Students are encouraged to bring their own problems related to their thesis, research projects or potential research in civil engineering that they will pursue near future. This course gives special attention to exploring theory and potential techniques in the field of smart structure to address real problems that students are exposed to or involved in. Thus, students need to devise feasible project topics that are achievable within your current or future graduate study. For example, it is too vague like *"we will build a robot to automatically and rapidly construct a building"* or *"we will develop a new vision sensor that can measure 3D volume"*. 

Individual/team should clearly identify the challenges of existing applications, procedures, and research in civil engineering and then consider how smart structure technology contributes to addressing them. The project does not have to be big, fancy and innovative if your project outcomes can marginally improve existing problems or advance practices. For example, it could be proposing a modification to existing processes, applying image processing and computer vision technology to streamline analysis and documentation processes, applying a new signal or image processing techniques to improve the accuracy of your technique. The possibilities are very open and diverse. 

The project can be done either individually or in teams of two or three students. If students choose to work in a team, they need to justify the need for a teamwork and define the scope of works in individual members. For the completion of the project, each group must reach the following **milestones**:

- **1-minute talk (at Class 05)**
- **Team/individual meeting (4th week)**
- **Abstract submission (6th week)**
- **3-minute presentation (at Class 18)**
- **10-minute final presentation (at Class 24)**
